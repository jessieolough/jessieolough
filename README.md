- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jessica O'Loughlin, a PhD Student at the University of Edinburgh and I work part-time at the EdinOmics Mass Spectrometry Facility 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in automating metabolomics, proteomics, and microbiome data analysis pipelines
- ðŸŒ± For my PhD, I study the metabolism of bacterial co-cultures where I am also developing a Python-based pipeline to automate the processing of raw data collected from LC-IM-QToF mass spectrometry methods. In my part-time work, I develop Python Dash apps to automate metabolomics statistical analyses and create interactive reports for customers to better navigate their data.
